/home/myless/.mambaforge/envs/mace-11.7/lib/python3.11/site-packages/nequip/__init__.py:20: UserWarning: !! PyTorch version 1.13.1+cu117 found. Upstream issues in PyTorch versions 1.13.* and 2.* have been seen to cause unusual performance degredations on some CUDA systems that become worse over time; see https://github.com/mir-group/nequip/discussions/311. The best tested PyTorch version to use with CUDA devices is 1.11; while using other versions if you observe this problem, an unexpected lack of this problem, or other strange behavior, please post in the linked GitHub issue.
